# Array has a constant time lookup because it is storing the current index in RAM.
# If a[0] is at a memory location 2000, then a[1] is guaranteed to be at location 2002
# Thus the current index is cached and recalled from RAM making the access time a constant time operation
# The resizing cannot be done by RAM since it cant be stored before so that is a linear time operation but if we double the capacity it is amortized constant time operation of O(1)
# Array with its current index is stored in RAM.
# Resizing is done in O(N) time

#Space Complexity O(N) since we store the array in memory
