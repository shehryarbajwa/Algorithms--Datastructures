Run-time analysis:

Task0:

The run time for each query is going to be O(1) since both print statements require lookups and not iterating over the 2D array
The average run time will be O(1)

Task1:

The run time for the outer loop is going to be O(n) since it is going to iterate over each call in the calls array. The run time for the inner if loop is also going to be O(n) since  the if loop will keep on iterating till it has found the key or exhausted the array.

Task2:

The run time for the for in loop is going to be O(n). Then each if loop will execute in constant time O(1). The second for loop would run in O(n) while the nested if loop in constant time. The run time for the entire algorithm is going to be O(n)

Task3:

In checking for area codes, each if loop would be in constant time O(1). For iterating over the calls, that would be done in O(n) while each nested if loop would again run in constant time. The sorting of the array would be done in O(nlogn). The total run time complexity is going to be O(nlogn)

Task4:

The run time for the for loop would be O(n) and for each nested if loop, it will be in constant time. The run time for the second for loop would be O(n). The sorting of the array would be done in O(nlogn). The total run time complexity is going to be O(nlogn)
