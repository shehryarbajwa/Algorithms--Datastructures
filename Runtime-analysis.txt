Run-time analysis:

Task0:

The run time for each query is going to be O(1) since both print statements require lookups and not iterating over the 2D array
The average run time will be O(1)

Task1:

The run time for each for-if loop is O(n). The total run time for both for loops when run isolated from each other 
will be (m+n). Since the constant values are a minuscule determinant in the run time of the overall program
we can just ignore it and the run time of the entire algorithm will be O(n)

Task2:

The run time for the for in loop is going to be O(n). Then each if loop will execute in constant time O(1). The second for loop would run in O(n) while the nested if loop in constant time. The run time for the entire algorithm is going to be O(m+n)

Task3:

In checking for area codes, each if loop would be in constant time O(1). For iterating over the calls, that would be done in O(n) while each nested if loop would again run in constant time. The total run time for the algorithm would be O(m+n) which will reduce to O(n)

Task4:

The run time for the for loop would be O(n) and for each nested if loop, it will be in constant time. The run time for the second for loop would be O(n). The total run time will be O(m + n) which will be reduced to just O(n)
