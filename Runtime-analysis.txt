Run-time analysis:

Task0:

The run time for each query is going to be O(1) since both print statements require lookups and not iterating over the 2D array
The average run time will be O(1)

Task1:

The run time for each for-if loop is O(n). The total run time for both for loops when run isolated from each other 
will be (m+n). Since the constant values are a minuscule determinant in the run time of the overall program
we can just ignore it and the run time of the entire algorithm will be O(n)

Task2:

The run time for the for in loop is going to be O(n). Then each if loop will execute in constant time O(1). The while loop for extrapolating the duration from the calls will run in O(n) time. The total run time will be O(n+m) which will just reduce to O(n) in the average case scenario

Task3:

The run time for the for loop would be O(n) and for each nested if loop, it will be in constant time. The overall run time of the program would be O(n)

Task4:

The run time for the for loop would be O(n) and for each nested if loop, it will be in constant time. The overall run time of the program would be O(n)
