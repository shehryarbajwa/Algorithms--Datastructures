### Problem 5 - Blockchain

### Explanation

I use a python list to build out the Block object. All operations are done on the py list. All new elements are added towards the end of the list. 

### Efficiency
n refers to the size of the input.
All methods operated on the list will be done in O(1) time. This includes add, get block and size. 

The space consumed by the list will be linear space complexity or O(n) in worst time case.
