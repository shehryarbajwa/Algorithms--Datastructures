### Problem 2 - File Recursion

### Explanation

I will be using a list to append to all the files that are found with the given extension name. Since we are going to be iterating over file and folders, this problem can be best solved via recursion. 

### Efficiency

Append has the time complexity of O(1) while Append has the time complexity of O(k)
